# story_circles
Sinatra Project, based on Dan Harmon's story circle.
Dan Harmon of "Community" and more recently of "Rick and Morty" fame, has repeatedly used
a simple diagram to chart out stories.

He suggests that all stories (at least the good ones) follow the same steps of the
"Hero's Journey" that Joseph Campbell outlined in "The Hero with A Thousand Faces."

Here are Dan Harmon's story circle steps:

1. YOU - the protagonist are in a position of comfort.
1. NEED - you wish to change your position.
1. GO - you enter an unfamiliar situation.
1. SEARCH - you adapt to your unfamiliar situation.
1. FIND - you find what you are looking for.
1. TAKE - you pay for what you are looking for.
1. RETURN - you return to your original position.
1. CHANGE - you change or are capable of change.

To run this application, all you need to do is to clone it and run:
'rake db:migrate'

After that, run shotgun and copy the url in the terminal into your browser.

Once you've created an account, you can start making new story circles and see past ones.
